Changes from 0.2 to 0.3 - released 2010/6/17

*General:

- added a new template operator: numQueries(bool $cluster).
  It returns the number of queries executed so far, either in the main db or in the cluster db

- added a new template operator: addTimingPoint(string $label).
  It is equivalent to ezDebug::addTimingPoint() in php.
  The timing point added will be shown in the debug info.
  It is useful e.g. to measure the memory and processing time consumed by a particular piece of template code

*Bugfixes:
